Here's the things that i have made so far :
- MY OWN LOGGING SYSTEM XD!
- Shader Class
- Texture Class
- Sprite Renderer 
- Entity Class
- Renderer Class (Should NOT be called Exactly Renderer, after seeing your BLESSED videos)
- GUI System (IMGUI XD)
  - BUTTONS
  - TEXT LABEL
  - SLIDERS (Any Type)
  - CHECKBOXES
 - Resource Manager 
   - Create Shader once by SPECIFYING its name (must be unique/different for each shaders)
   - Get the Shader from ANYWHERE by specifying the name of the shader
